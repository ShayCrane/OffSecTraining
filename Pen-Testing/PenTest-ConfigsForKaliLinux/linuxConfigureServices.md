### Configuring Services

*Notes from Offensive Security's training portal at https://OffSec.com.*


-------


#### How to Enable a Service
</br>
Kali Linux has a policy enabled by default that disables network services by default. Services can be manually enabled by running the following commands, replacing the example syntax with the given service name:
</br>
>sudo systemctl enable [service]

</br></br>

#### How to Configure a Specific Program
</br>

##### Read package maintainer's documentation:
</br>
Before beginning configuration changes, read the documentation provided by the package maintainer.  On Kali Linux (and other Debian-based OS's), this file is found here:
</br>

>usr/share/doc/package/README.Debian

</br></br>

##### Read official documentation for the software:
</br>

Configuration files are located in /etc/.

</br>

>dpkg -L [packageName]

</br>

prints list of files included with package to the screen,

</br></br>

>dpkg -s [packageName]

</br>

print package meta-data, recommended packages
this is useful for making the search for documentation or configuration utility much easier.

</br></br>


Most config files are edited by opening with sudo permissions, then uncommenting the appropriate lines within it.  Typically you will find easily-read explanatory text about each configuration setting option, so the user understands the expected behavior of the changed setting once implemented.


</br></br>

Example config files can be found in the directory below.  Use these to create your own configuration files:
</br>

>/usr/share/doc/package/examples/

</br>
